Introduction:
The project endeavours to analyse a dataset of population over the years for the world and India. The outcome of this analysis is presented in the form of line graphs and histogram respectively.

Objectives, Scope and Application:
●	To map a dataset to a graphical format so as to make it comprehensible and easier to observe trends.
●	To compare datasets more effectively in this format.

Design of Application:
●	Using the csv module to access dataset file contents in the code and storing them in lists.
●	Using the mplcursors module to enable a dynamic interface whilst hovering over graphs.
●	Using matplotlib module to represent the outcome of the analysis graphically.

Expected Conclusions:
●	Realization that graphical representation of a dataset is more impactful than just the numbers themselves.
